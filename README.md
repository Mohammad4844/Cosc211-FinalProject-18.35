## Project Topic
#### Exercise 18.35 (H-Tree Fractal)
An H-tree (introduced at the beginning of this chapter in Figure 18.1) is a fractal defined as follows:
1. Begin with a letter H. The three lines of H are of the same length, as shown in Figure 18.1a.
2. The letter H(in its sans-serif form, H) has four endpoints. Drawan H centered at each of the four endpoints to an H-tree of order 1, as shown in Figure 18.1b. These Hs are half the size of the H that contains the four endpoints.
3. Repeat Step 2 to create an H-tree of order 2, 3, . . . , and so on, as shown in Figures 18.1c and d.
Write a program that draws an H-tree, as shown in Figure 18.1.
